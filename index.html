      <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
      <p><h5>I am foremost a military brat; having grown up throughout the midwest.
        Born in Columbia, Missouri on May 11, 1992, the world was never to be quite the same after that date.
        Not that I have radically changed the world, but I truly feel the world changes everyday in meaningful ways.
        My family consists of a school nurse mother and a air force psychologist father, a speech pathologist older sister
        and a  younger sister. I graduated in 2014 from the University of Missouri-Columbia
        with a bachelor's in biology and have worked various jobs within laboratory environments. 
        I work as an independent research analyst and am looking for more work within biotechnology. 
        Data Science is a passion, and I hope make more meaning with it in more imaginable ways.</h5></p>
